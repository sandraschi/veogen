# Analysis: Google Gemini CLI June 2025 Blog Post

## Summary of the Official Announcement
- Google announced Gemini CLI as a free, open-source AI agent for the terminal, supporting Gemini 2.5 Pro and media generation (Veo 3, Imagen, Lyria).
- The blog post claims the tool is open source, available on GitHub, and designed for coding, content creation, and media generation directly from the terminal.
- Key features include high free usage limits, extensibility via MCP, and integration with Gemini Code Assist.

## Repository Status
- The blog post and all major tech news articles (Ars Technica, TechCrunch, Medium) state that Gemini CLI is open source and available on GitHub.
- However, as of this analysis, **no official public repository URL is provided in the blog post or any referenced articles**.
- Attempts to clone likely repo names (e.g., `github.com/google/gemini-cli`) result in 404 errors.
- No direct download or install instructions are present in the blog post HTML.

## Referenced Articles
- All major tech news outlets (Ars Technica, TechCrunch, Medium, Pure AI) repeat Google's claim that the tool is open source and on GitHub, but none provide a direct link.
- Some developer blogs (e.g., Richard Seroter) mention the repo and documentation but do not link to a working repository.

## Conclusion
- **The official Google Gemini CLI repository is not currently public or the URL is not discoverable via official channels or major news coverage as of June/July 2025.**
- The blog post and all coverage are consistent in describing the tool as open source and available, but the actual code is not accessible.
- If/when the repo becomes public, it should be available via a link from the [official blog post](https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/) or the Google GitHub organization.
